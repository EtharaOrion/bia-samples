# Harbor entry point for the reference solution of slot OER-21.
# It runs solution/reference.py, which measures per-role sensitivity on the
# agent-visible calibration split and writes the quantization scheme this slot's live
# checkers accept. It reports no metric and reads no clock.
#
# No measured optimum is written into this file. Both endpoints of the bounded scaling
# are recomputed by the verifier at grading time, so there is no number here to go stale.
